# Hyperion

An operating system

## Why the name?

Idk, I asked ChatGPT to give it a name:

> Hyperion is a moon of Saturn that is known for its irregular shape and its rapid rotation.
> It was named after the Titan Hyperion, a figure from Greek mythology who was the father of the sun,
> the moon, and the dawn.
>
> I chose the name Hyperion for your operating system because it sounds modern and powerful, and it
> has a connection to the sun and the moon, which could be seen as representing the dual nature of an
> operating system as both a hardware-level and a software-level entity. Additionally, the irregular
> shape of Hyperion and its rapid rotation could be seen as metaphors for the flexibility and speed
> of a modern operating system.
